<ul><li>As part of an On Time Cooking order, you will be provided with the option to:</li><br>

<li>activate location tracking services on your smart device; or</li><br>
<li>enter the address that you will be leaving from to collect your order.</li><br>
<li>If location tracking services are activated, cooking will only commence once you are on-route to the store.</li><br>

<li>We will stop tracking your location once your order has been collected or after 3 hours, whichever is earlier.</li><br>

<li>If you instead choose to enter your address, the store will estimate your travel time and commence cooking accordingly.</li><br>

<li>Using the location data provided, the store will endeavour to provide you with a hotter, fresher pizza, ready upon your arrival.</li><br>

<li>Any location data obtained will be deleted after seven days.</li><br>
